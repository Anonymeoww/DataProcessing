            <p>This barchart shows the danceability of the
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018/version/1">
                top 100 songs on Spotify in 2018<a/>. Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on
                a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
                A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.<br>
            The point of this bar chart is to give an overview of the danceability. The bars are, however, in order.
            The first bar is the first song on the list, so you can click the link if you want to see the song titles.</p>
